I’m a mathematician based in Hamburg, recently graduated with a Master’s in Mathematics from Universität Hamburg. I am primarily interested in abstract algebra and category theory. My most recent work is on deformations of symmetric Frobenius algebras and structures on the category of functors between Grothendieck-Verdier Categories and was under the supervision of [<ins> Christoph Schweigert</ins>](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/schweigert/). I am currently looking to enter the workforce.
